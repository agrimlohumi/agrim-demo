Hello there  everyone.
<br>
I am Agrim Lohumi.Student at  JSS University, Noida, studying Computer Science and Engineering.I am new to GitHub and am learning about it little by little.This is my first ever repository that i have pushed on github.I am learning the commmands  and how github helps to maintain a well defined history of all the changes made to the files of the repository and allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project.
<br>
I aim to learn github and all the git commands efficiently by the end of 2025 and will make sure to upload a proper  working project by then on my github account.
<br>
Thank You!!
